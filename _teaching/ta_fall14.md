Physics 141 is the calculus based introductory mechanics course offered for undergraduates at University of Arizona, geared primarily towards engineering students. As a lab instructor for this course, I was responsible for two sections of about 25 students each. I would give a short quiz meant to check that the students had read the lab material before class, and then run a short overview of the concepts covered in the lab and a demonstration. Some weeks required more overview as the lab material was not always covered in the lectures first. I would then walk around and assist students as they worked in small groups to finish the lab.

I was also responsible for grading for my two sections. This included lab material -- quizzes, lab worksheets, lab reports every other week, and a lab practical at the end of the semester -- as well as homework. I also helped to proctor all midterms and the final exam, and grading of all exams was split between all of the TAs for the various sections of the class. Furthermore, all TAs, regardless of what they taught, were required to complete at least 2 hours of tutoring each week, which included students from a variety of classes.
