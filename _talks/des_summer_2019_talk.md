I spoke about a project for mitigating the impact of observing conditions in galaxy clustering. This would be done using a Gaussian Process to fit for the impact of the observing conditions on the over-density of galaxies. This was a brand new project at the time, and we ended up not using this method after all.

I gave this talk during one of the Large Scale Structure parallel sessions at the Dark Energy Survey collaboration meeting in June 2019.
