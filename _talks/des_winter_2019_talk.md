I spoke about my project for mitigating the systematic effect of observing conditions on galaxy clustering analyses by fitting a model which assumes the over-density of galaxies is added to a linear combination of the various observing conditions. I had some results already when applying this method to Year 1 Dark Energy Survey (DES) redMaGiC data, but was still finding that there was a bias after my correction was applied.

I gave this talk during one of the Large Scale Structure parallel sessions at the DES collaboration meeting in November 2019.
