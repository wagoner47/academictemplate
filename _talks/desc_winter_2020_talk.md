I spoke about the same project as in [Sussex in November 2019]({{site.baseurl}}/talks/des_winter_2019_talk), although this was the first time I had spoken about this project to the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Large Scale Structure (LSS) working group.

I gave this talk during one of the LSS parallel sessions at the DESC collaboration meeting in January 2020.
