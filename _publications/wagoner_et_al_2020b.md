excerpt: 'The line of sight velocity dispersion profile of galaxy clusters exhibits a "kink" corresponding to the spatial extent of orbiting galaxies. Because the spatial extent of a cluster is correlated with the amplitude of the velocity dispersion profile, we can utilise this feature as a gravity-calibrated standard ruler. Specifically, the amplitude of the velocity dispersion data allows us to infer the physical cluster size. Consequently, observations of the angular scale of the "kink" in the profile can be translated into a distance measurement to the cluster. Assuming the relation between cluster radius and cluster velocity dispersion is known from simulations, we forecast that when utilising existing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we will be able to measure the Hubble constant with 3% precision. Implementation of our method with data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will result in a âˆ¼1.3% measurement of the Hubble constant. Adding cosmological supernova data improves the uncertainty of the DESI measurement to 0.7%.'

### Summary
This is a methods paper introducing a new distance measurement. It makes use of the results in [Tomooka et al (2020)](tomooka_et_al_2020) as a standard ruler that can be calibrated in simulations. It seems like it should give a competitive measurement of the Hubble contsant with DESI, although that will depend on how well-calibrated the cluster edge radius actually is and how much the measurement depends on other things like the cluster catalog used.
